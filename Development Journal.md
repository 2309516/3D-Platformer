- As I have worked on 3D games in Unity in the past I wanted to challlenge myself to see if i would be able to implement a system I havent used before and I decided on a grappling hook. I wanted to specifically also use tools within unity that I havent done before so the grappling hook and using Spring Joints to make this work was my main goal within the task.
