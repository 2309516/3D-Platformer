## Research
### Relevant sources and references

- As I have worked on 3D games in Unity in the past I wanted to challlenge myself to see if i would be able to implement a system I havent used before and I decided on a grappling hook. I wanted to specifically also use tools within unity that I havent done before so the grappling hook and using Spring Joints to make this work was my main goal within the task. 

- I wanted to the grapple to feel less like a traditional grappling hook where the player is just pulled to the hook location but rather to be similar to a swing connected to both the player and wherever the hook lands. 

 - My main help with the implementation of spring joints was the official Unreal Documentation
